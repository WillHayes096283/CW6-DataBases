## Program's Purpose
The purpose of this program is to demostrate the usage of databases in Visual Studios. The program read data from an Access 2016 file, and using a GUI print data from the
Asset data table into a textbox and the Employee data table into another textbox using the two respective buttons near the bottom of the GUI.

## Compilation Instructions-
1). Connect to the GitHub repo in Visual Studios and perform a git pull.
2). Make sure the Employee Access 2016 file is downloaded and connected to the program in Visual Studios
3). Click the green Start button in the Visual Studio menu to start the program.

## Notes-
* There's a grammatically mistake in the Access file, and I couldn't fix it due to the file behaving erractically. So, I elected to not fix for know because I don't want
risk breaking something
* This program is part of a short and simple assignment so I didn't bother making it look nice.
* Had some issues with the MainWindow.xaml.cs file saying that the provider in the connection string didn't exist.
